      <p><i>horseman i. FAMINE</i></p>
<p>The bagels suck here. On a Friday night my friend texts me, “If <i>Girls</i> was set in 2023, Hannah would be telling everyone she’s autistic.” I hit the emphasis (!) button. I am sitting at a bar in New Orleans either on a date with a stranger from the apps or waiting for someone to talk to me. I have been struggling to make new friends, or maybe I am making new friends but have forgotten what this process normally looks like after a decade in New York City where all my friendships were Grandfathered in from Youth. Nobody in this new town is loud enough or cares about Architectural Digest celebrity home tours: I am lost.</p>
<p>I’ve gained thirty pounds but my mind feels emaciated. This gauntness is exemplified when I interpret my Southern roommate saying, “I’m not really into Natasha Lyonne” as anti-semetic. At least I can drink outside here. So I sip whiskey and trace the fucked up sidewalks and phone my Northern neurotics—we are not bound my geography but bad vibes—who tell me of the unseasonably warm winter, which everyone agrees is a harbinger of the impending apocalypse.</p>
<p>“No fair!” I say.</p>
<p>This all started after my childless 69-year-old boss complimented my email style. She used the word “intrepid,” which made me want to slit my wrists with my Citibank Mastercard. But killing myself is too much like something someone like me would do, you see, and the only thing scarier than being called intrepid in an office is predictability. Instead I decided to sell the clothes I liked to wear before my best friend died and I got fat, and bought a ticket for a place nicknamed The Big Easy.</p>
<p><i>horseman ii. CONQUEST</i></p>
<p>My temperament and this new locale seemed perfectly suited at first. In the swamp, no one appears upwardly mobile, few discuss work at all even, and though the coastline is vanishing at an alarming rate, deluge seems far from everybody’s mind. My lack of ambition wasn’t questioned for a few weeks, but eventually eyes began to narrow, not in the exclusively drunk way. I heeded the collective skepticism by going out with a college guidance counselor. A pro at assessing potential, right? After a few drinks, I followed him to his car for a blowjob or something orbiting fucking, but the crunch of dozens of empty fast food containers lining the floor of his SUV kill the mood. What did he know about life? I made an excuse to leave with a promise to meet again, which was a lie.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing that a lot lately, lying to men, employers, my parents, to everyone except the ones who count, like the doctor screening me for an experimental hair loss treatment where I could make 100 bucks per visit. Apparently tobacco is a no-no when it comes to experimental drugs for hair loss. I wanted to tell them, I can’t be bald and not smoke, what will I have left? You know, like a joke. But instead I lie again and say that I understand.</p>
<p>When I’m not being deceitful, I take long drives between Louisiana and Texas to visit my family. On stretches of road under big skies I feel I can outrun my troubles. It’s probably something to do with the indisputable movement of cruising hundreds of miles, terrain dotted in my periphery while a song plays for a few minutes during which the terrible enormity of being alive feels withstandable, like maybe I’m a fish versus a whale and nothing is really that deep.</p>
<p><i>horseman iii. WAR</i></p>
<p>I’m fundamentally mistrustful of therapy. Prodding a tortured psyche runs the risk of doing more harm than good, at least in my mind. However, I respect the practice as a form of emotional bloodletting. Doesn’t obsessive analysis of your feelings just get you bluer? Besides, consistent happiness is gauche, something for Versailles, not rentals with shit water pressure. I’ve got my own method. When bad things happen, I flatten their dimensions, mold them into a shape I can cope with and add it to the pile. Then when I’m 74 or near-death I can look back and presumably the pile will have taken shape, now a sculpture which says something or, at least, could if you look at it long enough. What else could a therapist expect from me?</p>
<p>Still, I’ve decided to try Wellbutrin because everybody’s doing it and drugs are awesome. Did you know you can get antidepressants now simply by filling out an online survey? Multiple choice smiley or frowny face, think the “How clean was this bathroom?” polls you find in airports. Benzos still require face-time with a doctor, though. Which is basically just a verbal CAPTCHA, the questionnaire equivalent of <i>Check this box if you’re human</i>. It’s very cruel, very human to make us dance for Xanax.</p>
<p>(OK so I didn’t actually take the Wellbutrin once it arrived as it impeded my ability to day-drink. Sometimes I wish I were simply bipolar. My friends assure me I’m not—they’re in therapy so they would know—which I guess just makes me a moody motherfucker. Which blows because that implies that, somewhere inside, I naturally possess the tools to control how I feel.)</p>
<p><i>horseman iv. DEATH</i></p>
<p>Earthquakes, floods, UFOs, nuclear war, AI art, the prospect of three more Avatar sequels: I’m loving all the bleak visions of the apocalypse. My friends and I like to play this game where we each guess how much longer we believe our planet has. The most popular theory is that climate change will result in mass migrations which will destabilize global democracies a few decades before natural disasters engulf our cities. Remember when talking about the weather was considered small talk? Although, as someone recently pointed out to me, the Earth will be fine, actually. Humanity’s understanding of “the world” might be over, but like the Ice Age, different species will survive as the planet reaches a new stasis. I heard this on a rainy day when I was very hungover and the concrete sidewalks were spotted with big puddles. It made me want to cry.</p>
